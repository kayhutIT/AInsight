    "llm_summary": "This file appears to be the main source file (`main.c`) of a simple C project. Here's an explanation of its components:\n\n1. **File Path**:  \n   `C:\\Users\\uzann\\Downloads\\simple_c_project\\src\\main.c`  \n   The file is located in the `src` folder within a project directory named `simple_c_project`.\n\n2. **Function Prototype**:  \n   `int main(void)`  \n   - This is the entry point of the program, as `main()` is the standard starting function in C.  \n   - The return type is `int`, which typically indicates the exit status of the program (e.g., `0` for success, non-zero for errors).  \n   - `(void)` means no arguments are passed to `main`.\n\n3. **Included Headers**:  \n   - `stdio.h`: The standard C library for input/output operations (e.g., `printf`, `scanf`).  \n   - `util.h`: Likely a custom header file (`util.h`) from the project containing utility functions. If this is part of the project, it is probably placed in the `src` or `include` directory.\n\n4. **Comment**:  \n   There’s no explicit comment in the provided code, but this could imply that the file is minimal or placeholder code for a larger project.\n\n### Possible Purpose:\nThis file likely serves as the starting point for a basic C program, possibly using utility functions defined in `util.h`. A simple implementation might look like:\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include \"util.h\"  // Custom utility functions\n\nint main(void) {\n    printf(\"Program started.\\n\");\n    \n    // Example use of a function from util.h\n    int result = add_numbers(5, 3);  \n    printf(\"Result: %d\\n\", result);\n    \n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nIf you share the contents of `util.h` or the full code, I can provide a more specific explanation!"

    "llm_summary": "### Explanation of the `print_message` Function in `util.c`\n\nThe given information describes a C function named `print_message` in the file `util.c`. Here's a breakdown of the provided details and their implications:\n\n#### 1. **File Location**:\n   - `C:\\Users\\uzann\\Downloads\\simple_c_project\\src\\util.c`\n   - This file is part of a simple C project, located in the `src` (source) directory. The project is likely a small program or library, and `util.c` contains utility functions (like `print_message`).\n\n#### 2. **Function Prototype**:\n   ```c\n   void print_message(const char *filename)\n   ```\n   - **Return Type**: `void`  \n     The function does not return any value.\n   - **Parameter**: `const char *filename`  \n     The function takes a single argument: a pointer to a string (filename), marked as `const` to indicate the string's contents will not be modified by the function.\n\n#### 3. **Includes**:\n   - `stdio.h` and `util.h` are included in `util.c`.\n     - `stdio.h` is the standard C library for input/output operations (e.g., `printf`, `fopen`).\n     - `util.h` is likely a local header file in the project, containing the prototype for `print_message` and possibly other utility functions.\n\n#### 4. **Comment**:\n   - No explicit comment is provided, but given the function name and parameters, we can infer its purpose.\n\n#### Inferred Behavior:\nThe function `print_message` probably reads the contents of the file specified by `filename` and prints them to the standard output (console). Here's a plausible implementation:\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include \"util.h\"\n\nvoid print_message(const char *filename) {\n    FILE *file = fopen(filename, \"r\"); // Open file in read mode\n    if (file == NULL) {\n        perror(\"Error opening file\"); // Print error if file cannot be opened\n        return;\n    }\n\n    char line[256]; // Buffer to store each line\n    while (fgets(line, sizeof(line), file)) { // Read line by line\n        printf(\"%s\", line); // Print each line\n    }\n\n    fclose(file); // Close the file\n}\n```\n\n#### Key Details:\n1. **Error Handling**: Checks if the file can be opened (`fopen` returns `NULL` on failure).\n2. **File Reading**: Uses `fgets` to read the file line by line.\n3. **Output**: Prints each line to the console using `printf`.\n4. **Resource Cleanup**: Closes the file with `fclose`.\n\n#### Usage Example:\nIf called with `print_message(\"example.txt\")`, the function would print the contents of `example.txt` to the console. If the file doesn't exist, it would print an error (e.g., \"Error opening file: No such file or directory\").\n\n#### Assumptions:\n- The function is meant for text files (not binary files).\n- The file is not extremely large (to avoid overwhelming the console or memory issues with the fixed-size buffer).\n\nThis function is a simple utility for displaying file contents, typical in small C projects."
