# Executive Summary

Based on the two provided functions, here's an executive summary of the likely codebase structure and purpose:

**Purpose**:  
The code appears to be a minimal C program focused on processing or interacting with files, where `print_message` is a utility function likely responsible for displaying file-related information or content, while `main` serves as the entry point with potential file handling operations.

**Key Characteristics**:
1. **File-Centric Operation**:  
   The presence of `print_message` with a `filename` parameter suggests the program interacts with external files (reading, logging, or displaying their contents).

2. **Modular Design**:  
   The separation of `print_message` from `main` indicates a modular approach, where display logic is decoupled from core workflows for reusability.

3. **Deterministic Execution**:  
   `main` takes no parameters (`void`), implying the program either:  
   - Uses hardcoded file paths, or  
   - Gathers input via other means (e.g., user input or configuration files).

**Flow**:  
1. The `main` function orchestrates execution, potentially opening/processing files.  
2. File paths or data are passed to `print_message`, which formats and outputs relevant information (to stdout, logs, etc.).

**Limitations**:  
Without additional functions or context, the summary is constrained. Key unknowns include:  
- How files are selected/processed in `main`  
- Whether `print_message` handles errors  
- The actual message format/output target  

**Inference**:  
This is likely a lightweight utility (e.g., a log viewer, file content dumper, or part of a toolchain) prioritizing simplicity and single-file operations.

## main.c – int main(void)
**Includes:** stdio.h, util.h
**Resources:** ../resources/message.txt

**Summary:** This function is a simple C program's `main` function that prints a message from a file and exits.

### **Purpose:**
The function's purpose is to read and display the contents of a message file located at `"../resources/message.txt"` and then terminate the program successfully.

### **Behavior:**
1. **Includes:**  
   - `stdio.h` – Likely required for basic I/O operations (though `print_message` itself might use other I/O functions).  
   - `util.h` – Likely a custom or third-party header that defines `print_message`.  

2. **Function Call:**  
   - Calls `print_message("../resources/message.txt")`, which presumably:
     - Opens the file `"../resources/message.txt"` (relative to the program's working directory).  
     - Reads its contents.  
     - Prints them to `stdout` (standard output, typically the console).  
     - Closes the file.  

3. **Return Statement:**  
   - Returns `0`, indicating successful execution to the operating system.  

### **Assumptions & Notes:**
- `print_message` is assumed to handle file opening errors gracefully (e.g., printing an error message or exiting if the file is missing).  
- The path `"../resources/message.txt"` suggests the file is in a `resources` directory one level above the program's execution directory.  
- No additional logic is present (e.g., user input, further processing).  

This function is essentially a minimal example of file reading in C, often used in introductory programming or as part of a larger system where messages are stored externally.

## util.c – void print_message(const char *filename)
**Includes:** stdio.h, util.h

**Summary:** ### Purpose:
The `print_message` function is designed to read the contents of a file specified by its filename and print those contents to the standard output (usually the console or terminal).  

### Behavior:  
1. **File Opening**:  
   - The function takes a `filename` (a C-string representing the file path) and attempts to open it in read mode (`"r"`).  
   - If the file cannot be opened (e.g., it doesn’t exist or lacks permission), the function calls `perror` to print an error message (indicating the reason for failure) and returns immediately.

2. **File Reading & Output**:  
   - If the file opens successfully, the function reads it character by character using `fgetc` until it reaches the end-of-file (`EOF`).  
   - Each character is printed to the standard output (`stdout`) via `putchar`.  

3. **Cleanup**:  
   - After reading the entire file, the function closes the file handle (`fclose`) to release system resources.  

### Notes:  
- **Input**: `filename` is expected to be a valid path (absolute or relative to the program’s working directory).  
- **Output**: The function directly prints to `stdout`, emitting the file’s raw content, including whitespace and special characters.  
- **Error Handling**: Only file-opening errors are handled; reading errors (e.g., disk failure mid-read) are not explicitly checked.  
- **Dependencies**: Relies on `stdio.h` for file I/O functions and `util.h` (though no utilities from it are used in the snippet).  

### Example:  
If `filename` points to `greeting.txt` containing:  
```
Hello, world!
```  
Calling `print_message("greeting.txt")` would output:  
```
Hello, world!
```
